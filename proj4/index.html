  </a>
    <blockquote><b>
      Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. 
      To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again. 
      You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.
      <br />
      <small>
      Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? 
      A high <code>ks</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      With a low ks, the top part of the cloth caves in more, and is also a lot more crinkly (at very low ks the crinkles disappear and it just caves in after coming to a rest), the bottom of the cloth drops lower, and it does not flap around very much during the animation (almost like the whole thing is heavier). At high ks, the top part of the cloth only caves in a little bit, and there is a single large crease instead of many crinkles. The cloth flaps around slightly more than low ks, but comes to rest with the bottom part being very flat just like low ks.
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Low density looks a lot like high ks, with small deformation near the top, and a rather smooth rest state. High density makes the top cave in more just like low ks, but instead of many small creases it has a few large curves that run through the cloth. The bottom half is also not as smooth as low ks.
    </p>
    
    
    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Low damping makes the cloth drop down very fast, and flap around wildly afterwards. It swings back and forth several times before coming to rest, with a lot of small bounces as well. High damping makes the cloth fall slower, and there is way less or virtually no swing after it drops down completely. It just comes to rest while the entire cloth stay mostly smooth and almost rigid throughout. 
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
      For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters 
      and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.

    <p>
      After reaching the rest state, the cloth with high ks appears smooth and the top is less caves in. This makes sense intuitively as higher ks=stronger spring forces=the top edge being held from either side more tightly.

      After a few seconds, the default cloth is already almost at the rest state, while the one with low damping is still swinging and flapping. This is because low damping causes forces and momentum to dissipate a lot slower.

      For low density, the cloth does not fold on itself too many times, with only a few smooth curves. After falling down, the cloth reaches a smooth rest state rather quickly.

    </p>
    <p>
      For high density, the cloth folds on itself many times, with a lot of wrinkles. After falling down, the cloth actually stays more folded for a while before bouncing into a smoother rest state with only one fold as shown in the previous question.

    </p>
    <p>
      For low ks, the cloth again folds on itself many times with a lot of small creases; it also takes longer to go into a smooth rest state just like high density.

    <p>
      For high ks, the cloth is again more smooth just like low density, with fewer and larger folds.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader is a program that runs on the GPU to create visual effects such as lighting and material properties, and for 3D models and scenes. Shaders can manipulate the geometry, color, and texture of 3D objects in real-time.

    </p>
    <p>
      Vertex shaders operate on each vertex of a 3D object and are responsible for transforming the object's geometry and position in 3D space. 

    </p>
    <p>
      Fragment shaders operate on each pixel that the object covers on the screen. They are responsible for determining the color and other properties of the pixel based on the material and lighting conditions.

    </p>
    <p>
      The vertex shader computes the per-vertex values, which is interpolated and then passed into the fragment shader to calculate the per-pixel values that become the colors we see on the screen.

    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model is a widely used method for calculating shading. It works by calculating the intensity of light reflected from a surface using a combination of ambient, diffuse, and specular components. The ambient component is a constant color value that represents the overall brightness of the scene. The diffuse component represents the amount of light that is scattered in all directions when it hits a surface, and is determined by the angle between the surface normal and the direction of the incoming light. The specular component represents the amount of light that is reflected in a specific direction, and is determined by the angle between the reflection direction and the viewer's line of sight.

    <p>
      Bump mapping samples the texture map for height at the specific point, then uses that data to adjust the normal vector at the point, and finally applies Blinn-Phong shading. This method can simulate the effect that the surface would have on lighting if it is of the material shown in the texture, without actually adjusting the sphere’s and the cloth’s curfaces. The resulting render is not all that different under different resolutions, and we see that the sphere and cloth appear to take on certain shapes while remaining smooth in reality

      Displacement mapping does the same as bump mapping, except it also adjusts the actual positions of the vertices in the vertex shader according to the sampled height. This means that with displacement mapping we will see both the simulated lighting effect on the surface material and the surface itself resembling the material shown in the texture image. These 2 effects being combined creates a much more convincing and plausible render of the desired material. Different resolutions make a very big difference for the shape of the sphere in displacement mapping, and we can see that the sphere turns from a rough polygon into a brick wall with detailed creases and edges as we increase the resolution.
